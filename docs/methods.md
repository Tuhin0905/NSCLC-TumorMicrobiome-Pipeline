# Methods (Scripts-only template)
This repo provides scripts for QC, trimming, host-removal (hg38), WoL/Woltka taxonomy,
diversity, Songbird + paired Wilcoxon, HUMAnN3 functional profiling, KO/MetaCyc + KO→KEGG,
pathway differential testing, and species–pathway Spearman correlations (FDR).
All paths are placeholders (/path/to/...); raw data/outputs are not distributed.
